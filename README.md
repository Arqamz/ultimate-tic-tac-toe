## What is Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe?

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic variant of the classic tic-tac-toe game. The game consists of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3Ã—3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in any of the smaller boards, but the location of their move determines which board the opponent must play in next.
